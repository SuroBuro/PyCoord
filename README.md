# PyCoord

## What's the use of this script?
It's a python script which enables me to efficiently calculate coordinates of places given coordinates and distances

## Dependencies
* math
* pyproj

##Goals
* I plan to make it into a plugin for QGIS so that I could obtain a smooth workflow of sectioning off places on the map
* Adding ability to output a log file
* Interfacing with QGIS

##Features
* It outputs in both x-y coordinates for the pseudo Webmercator projection EPSG:3857 from coordinates of EPSG:4326
